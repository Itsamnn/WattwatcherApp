# Running WattsWatcher on Android Emulator

## Method 1: Android Studio GUI
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open project: `F:\project\flutter app`

4. Choose Pixel 6/7 with API 34 (Android 14)
5. Click Run button

## Method 2: Command Line

### Start Emulator
```bash
# List available AVDs
emulator -list-avds

# Start specific AVD (replace 'Pixel_6_API_34' with your AVD name)
emulator -avd Pixel_6_API_34
```

### Install APK
```bash
# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on running emulator
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Or build and install in one step
./gradlew installDebug
```

## Method 3: Direct Run from Command Line
