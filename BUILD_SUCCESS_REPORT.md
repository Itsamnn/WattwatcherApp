# WattsWatcher Build Success Report

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESS

The WattsWatcher Android app now compiles successfully with Java 21 and Gradle 8.13!

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Hilt Dependency Injection**
- Removed all `@HiltViewModel`, `@Inject`, and `@AndroidEntryPoint` annotations
- Replaced with manual dependency injection using `viewModel { }` factory
- Cleaned up all Hilt-related imports and modules

### 2. **Fixed @Composable Context Issues**
- Fixed `@Composable invocations can only happen from the context of a @Composable function` errors
- Moved `LocalContext.current` calls inside @Composable functions
- Restructured ViewModels to use proper dependency injection

### 3. **Resolved Type Mismatches**
- Fixed `Double` vs `Int` type mismatches in device power calculations
- Converted between API models (`DeviceUsage`, `TariffSlab`, `PaymentRecord`) and UI models (`DeviceConsumption`, `Tariff`, `Payment`)
- Fixed property name mismatches (`currentUsage` vs `watts`)

### 4. **Eliminated Duplicate Declarations**
- Removed duplicate state classes that were causing redeclaration errors
- Consolidated state definitions in ViewModels

### 5. **Fixed Import Conflicts**
- Resolved conflicting imports by using fully qualified class names
- Cleaned up unused imports

### 6. **Enhanced Architecture**
- Implemented `SimulationEngine` for realistic real-time data simulation
- Created comprehensive data models with proper serialization
- Established clean repository pattern without Room dependency
